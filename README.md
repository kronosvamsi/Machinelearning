# Machinelearning

Hello,

This is the  linear regression model written in python. It is a  simple 3 degree polynomial  model trained on 2 input feature data . Here model learned by 
online learning algorithm known stochastic gradient descent algorithm. The loss function used  Sqaure loss error function OR L2 loss error function.
